## 📎 Requirements
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)-v16 
* [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/)-v13
* [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for lavalink
* [Lavalink](https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1)

Note: Java v11 or newer is required to run the Lavalink.jar. Java v13 is recommended. If you are using sdkman then its a manager, not Java, you have to install sdkman and use sdkman to install Java

Warning: Java v14 has issues with Lavalink.

<!-- INSTALL -->
## 🚀 Installation from source
```
git clone https://github.com/XBFTW/XBFTW-BOT.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
* Start the bot with `node .`

to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.
